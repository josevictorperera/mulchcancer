            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to our educational website exploring the impact of wood air pollution on human health.
                This website aims to provide valuable information on the sources, effects, and preventive measures
                related to wood-burning pollution.

            <h2>Sources of Wood Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>
                Wood air pollution primarily stems from the combustion of wood for heating and cooking purposes.
                Common sources include wood stoves, fireplaces, and open burning. These activities release
                pollutants into the air, contributing to environmental and health concerns.

            <h2>Effects on Human Health</h2>
            <p>
                Exposure to wood smoke can have adverse effects on respiratory health. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
                and other pollutants released during wood combustion can penetrate deep into the lungs, leading to
                respiratory issues such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

            <h2>Preventive Measures</h2>
            <p>
                To minimize the impact of wood air pollution, it's essential to adopt cleaner and more efficient
                wood-burning practices. This includes using EPA-certified stoves, proper wood storage and seasoning,
                and exploring alternative heating methods. Additionally, raising awareness about the issue can
                contribute to community efforts to reduce wood smoke pollution.
